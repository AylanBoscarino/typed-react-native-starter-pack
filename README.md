# React Native Starter Pack

## A starter pack for React Native Applications with Typescript and Wix's React Native Navigation

Starting a project in React Native can be a pain, particularly if we don't
like using a general bundler like Expo due to the increase in the size of the
app and the fact it can't use certain libraries like [Wix's React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/).
It's even more tiresome when we wish to add Redux to our project because of the load of
boilerplate it demands before we can start working with it.

I built this starter pack just for that: to start my new React Native projects with
Typescript using React Native Navigation and with Redux's boilerplate already
done.

Plus I added some docblocks here and there to clarify where i put everything and why,
the documentation generate by [Typedoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc)
was the cherry on top of the cake.
